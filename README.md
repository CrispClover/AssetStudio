# CrispAssetStudio

This is a small toolset to help you when setting up scenes in Unreal. Originally made for my own portfolio work, things got a bit out of hand and I figured other people might find this useful, maybe even for setting up lighting in cinematic shots.

You can make your own light presets in the data table found in the "Setup" folder.

## Installation
You can find the pre-built plugin [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_2n1ygZ--vBhWqp2QDwGngPSjzT-nWI2?usp=sharing). You can copy it into your project's plugin folder, or into the engine's plugin folder if you want to use it across multiple projects.

## Usage

I am working on a UI update right now, and will update this section as time goes on.

### Getting started
First, open the Map called "Studio" located in the main folder, then run the Editor Utility Widget, also located in the main folder. An Actor to display a Static Mesh is already located in the Level - you can set the mesh to be displayed using the Editor Widget. (You might have to scroll down to see the details of the Mesh Actor).

You can find all the Blueprints in the "BPs"-Folder. For now you'll have to explore the options in the Widget by yourself. Update coming soon!

## Feedback / Bugs / (Copyright)
Feedback and contributions are welcome. I might release updates if I get to it.
You may copy the code/blueprints into your own projects, but make sure to credit me somewhere visible if you do. *(It's nothing special at all, so you probably won't need to copy any of it anyways)*

If you encounter bugs, or need support in rebuilding the plugin for a different engine version feel free to let me know:

(Important) sidenote for **new** 3D artists who came here to use this in their portfolio work:
Make sure to show off all of your hard work. This includes showing the LODs, wireframe, and UV layouts of the meshes you've made.
