# CrispAssetStudio v2.1

This is a small toolset to help you when setting up scenes in Unreal. Originally made for my own portfolio work, things got a bit out of hand and I figured other people might find this useful, maybe even for setting up lighting in cinematic shots.

## Installation
You can find the pre-built plugin under "Releases" here on github. You can copy it into your project's plugin folder, or into the engine's plugin folder if you want to use it across multiple projects.

## [Getting started](https://github.com/CrispClover/AssetStudio/wiki)

Two tutorials will come. Eventually. I have already had a few recording sessions, but I wasn't happy with the results. I have now finally decided to have a feature overview here on the [wiki](https://github.com/CrispClover/AssetStudio/wiki). I will record my workflow with the plugin for a simple showcase and a still image as soon as I get to it.

## Feedback / Bugs / (Copyright)
Feedback and contributions are welcome. I might release updates if I get to it.
You may copy the code/blueprints into your own projects, but make sure to credit me somewhere visible if you do.

If you encounter bugs, or need support in rebuilding the plugin for a different engine version feel free to let me know:

(Important) sidenote for **new** 3D artists who came here to use this in their portfolio work:
Make sure to show off all of your hard work. This includes showing the LODs, wireframe, and UV layouts of the meshes you've made.
